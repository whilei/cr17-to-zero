 Thank you Ryan for inviting me to speak at Clojure Remote 2017. And /*welcome*/ to everyone whose with us today to hear about /The Value of Learning/.

 My name is Jay, and I'm enthralled by the subject of learning. Here's one example of why:

 5 days. That's it. These people, people not unlike you or me, learned the technical fundamentals of drawing in only *5 days*. 
 
 Personally, I'm /*astonished*/ by these drawings.
 
 It reminds of the scene in The Matrix, where Neo and Trinity see a helicopter. He asks her "Can you fly that thing?" and she replies, "Not yet". Moments later (NEXT FRAG) she is skillfully flying the aircraft.
 
 How does their teacher (NEXT FRAG), Betty Edwards, facilitate such progress for *all* of her students, not just some?
 
 And how is her approach relevant to learning other highly technical skills, such as programming?
 
 We'll explore these, and other engaging questions, over the next hour.

   I'm not an expert in programming, nor in the science of learning. 
   
   This talk is a slice of my life experiences around learning.
   
   Before we get started there's one more thing you need to know about this talk. 

   It's not just a one-way talk. It's been designed to evolve into a dynamic, community driven, conversation.

   It began its life open to community as an open source github repository, and has evolved into an open-data project, driven by your anonymous, interactive input.

   Scattered throughout the talk, you'll notice a red pill appear on the lower right corner of the screen.

   Each pill contains a QR code.

   If you want to particpate, please ready your smart phone to scan QR codes.

   These red-pill qr codes are mini-polls, links to kick-start your research or pre-filled tweets that will serve to network like minds around the subject of learning.

   Even if you're watching this on video, months or years from now, you can still participate by scanning the QR codes with your smart phone.

   This is your red pill, blue pill moment!

   Scan the red pill now if, like me, you were astonished by the drawings done by Betty Edward's students and are curious to learn more.

   No pressure though, think of this talk as a garden and pick the fruit that appeals to your senses.

   We're going to explore many aspects of learning through the framework of learning's /*worth*/.

   Let's get started!

* The question
How much do I value learning?

** Learning, the invisible value 
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. -- Bertrand Russell
  #+END_QUOTE

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
 Before we assess the central question of this talk, let me justify the question. /Education/, it seems, is among the most universally accepted of human values.

 At first glance the answer to the question, "Do I value learning?" appears to be so obvious that the question seems silly or trite, maybe even a complete waste of time.

 In a few moments, I'll draw a subtle distinction between the words education and learning which will further justify the question.

 Bertrand Russell said, "In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted."

 I believe that we have a lot to gain and nothing to lose by putting Bertrand Russell's wisdom to work on the subject of learning.

 Invisible values risk becoming neglected values. My hope is that by thoughtfully assessing the value of learning for ourselves, we can mitigate this risk and reach our individual and collective learning potential.

 At the very least, attempting to answer this question is in accord with the age old wisdom, "know thyself."

** Brain, the invisible organ
 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
 While learning may be the invisible value, the brain is the invisible organ. At least that's the excuse I use to explain why, in my youth, I was *not* very interested in the brain, or how I could use it to improve my life.

 For all its potential power, surely there must be some explanation why I wasn't in awe of the brain in my youth.

 A couple of reasons have come to mind:

 In my case, the brain science of the day led my teachers to inform me that I was given a fixed number of brain cells, and no new cells would ever be produced. What I heard was "You can't get any smarter. You're either smart or you're not."

 And here's another simple observation -- the brain has to compete with a heartbeat. As a very young child, getting to know my own body, the heartbeat was a constant reminder, "I have a heart!" 

 Maybe the brain just needs better PR. This talk hopes to remedy that.

** Understanding the question
How much do I value learning?

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Let's illuminate the question by looking at the meaning and history of the words /value/ & /learning/.

*** Value defined

*relative worth, utility, or importance*

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="citation">merriam-webster.com</div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
/Value/ as used in our central question means *relative worth, utility, or importance*.

#+END_NOTES

*** Etymology of /value/: 

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Anglo-French
_valu_    *worth, high quality*

Latin
_valēre_  *to be well, have strength*
#+END_SRC

Game of Thrones fans, please take note of the phonetic similarities to /Valyrian/ steel.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The history of the word value goes back through Middle English to the Anglo-French work /valu/, which means *worth* or *high quality*, and finally, all the way back to the Latin, /valēre/, which means *to be well* or *have strength*.

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, you've likely noticed how similar /valēre/ sounds to Valyria, home to the forges of Valyrian steel, which is renowned for its quality and strength.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Middle English
_lernen_  *to learn*

Old English
_leornian_  *to learn*

Old English
_last_  *foot print*

Latin
_lira_  *furrow, track*
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="citation">merriam-webster.com</div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The history of the word /learn/ goes back through the Middle English word /lernen/, which shares the meaning *to learn* with the Old English word /leornian/, and further back to the Old English word /last/ which means *foot print*, and finally, all the way back to the latin word /lira/ which means *furrow* or *track*.

The word furrow really stuck out to me. Firstly because I didn't know what it meant in this context, which is *a long trench*. But not just any trench! *a long narrow trench in the ground made by a plow, especially for planting seeds*. 

The latin meaning has become my favorite way to think about learning -- planting a trail of seeds, seeds of knowledge and skill, which will grow and flourish in time! How cool is that!?!

*** Learn as synonym for Teach

Master blacksmiths learned their apprentices in the craft of sword forging.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="citation">merriam-webster.com</div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
As far back as the 13th century, the word /learn/ was also used to mean "teach". As in "Master blacksmiths learned their apprentices in the craft of sword forging." 

Today this alternative meaning is relegated to speech, because it's *not* considered proper grammar.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
After the time of Socrates, humankind's progress in adult education experiences a small gap.

(NEXT FRAG canyon)

The 1926 paper /The Meaning of Adult Education/, by Eduard C. Lindeman, reignited the subject of learning and established a scientific, research oriented approach to understanding how adults learn.  

It's helpful to remember that the science of learning is a young science.

educare: to train or mold

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educare/ means: to train or mold.

Proponents of the "outside in" perspective of education seek to impart knowledge and form students by shaping them according to templates of idealized virtues and skill.

As in, "The University educates its students by exposing them to knowledge."

When I first encountered the Clojure programming language, I'd never heard anyone distinguish between identity, values & time.

I definitely needed some "outside in" education!

.

.
#+END_NOTES

*** Inside Out
educere: to lead out
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educere/ means: to lead out.

Advocates of the "inside out" perspective of education seek to prepare the student for the unpredictable challenges of the future by focusing the pupil's attention on the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge.

As in, "The students education is most evident in their lifelong curiosity about science and the world in which they live."

I take the position that both faces of education have their ideal time and place, and that we are in the early stages of discovering an ideal balance between the two.

The science and math scores in the U.S. over the past couple decades show an over-reliance on outside-in education.

Students here in the U.S. are given a new problem, immediately followed by the recipe to solve the problem.

In German, Japan and other high performing countries, students are challenged to think through the problem, after being reminded of recent supportive lessons.

Then students work in teams to try to solve the problem.

Only then, is the answer revealed, after which students compare their own strategies with the, quote "official answer".

Educators call this 'productive struggle'. 

I like to call it 'structured struggle', but whatever you call it, at its heart it's a prime example of "Inside Out" learning.

Even Socrates would be proud!

** Axiology
The philosophical study of value.
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Pursuing this question led me to the field of axiology, which is the philosophical study of value.

This study dates back to the time of ancient Greece, when Plato first wrote about the distinction between intrinsic value and instrumental value.

#+END_NOTES

*** Intrinsic vs Instrumental
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
According to axiology, learning has intrinsic value if it is valuable in and of itself.

Learning has instrumental value if it serves as a means toward achieving something else.

As in, "Learning to speak German helped me make new friends in Berlin."

#+END_NOTES

*** Limitations of Axiology
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Axiology provides a helpful framework for /thinking and talking/ about the value of something, because values are more nebulous than facts.

If values were facts, we could seek an answer to our question scientifically. Is there a way to convert values into facts?

What other fields might help us?

** Value Theory
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t

 # file:resources/images/2000px-MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg.png # in case of seriousness

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Value theory is a modern approach to understanding value. It stems from axiology, but seeks to determine value through scientific observation.

What do people value and why? Psychology, sociology and economics each provide a unique lens through which to study value.

For example, a sociologist might be interested in how different groups of people value learning similarly or differently.

An economist might choose to measure the value of learning in terms of goods and services related to learning which are sold in the marketplace.

They might also point out 'opportunity cost' as a means of assessing the value of learning.

If I choose to learn to speak German, what return on investment could've been realized with an alternate and equal investment in time and money?

A psychologist might seek to measure the value of learning by categorizing learning subjects according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

Value theory is encouraging us to find a quantifiable way of measuring the value of learning.

** Pragmatism

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
It's worth noting that some philosophers entirely reject the idea of intrinsic value.

John Dewey, in his book /Theory of Valuation/, sees the process of valuation as a continuous balancing of objectives, which change over time with new information.

** Flip the question

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
At this point in my research, I thought of a potential shortcut to answering the question. What if we could prove that learning was harmful?

We're in the age of information. Knowledge streams across the internet at up to two thirds the speed of light. Isn't it possible that malicious actors could use this information destructively?

I'm learning to program, and I want to help others learn too. Are these actions helping society or are they hurting?

This is an important question! If they're hurting, I should cease and desist now.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
So, /*is*/ learning harmful?

Upon asking this question, I struck gold in finding the article (NEXT FRAG) /Is knowledge "good" or "neutral"?/

The author, Piotr Wozniak, raises some of the same questions I was asking myself about malicious actors in the world.

Wozniak claims that Knowledge is good.

The article supports this claim by elaborating in great detail over a simple five-step chain of reasoning.

Wozniak argues that humans benefit through cooperation and lose out on conflict, and claims this truth can be demonstrated mathematically with the tools of game theory.

This article was chiefly responsible for justifying my natural instinct to help others learn.

We don't have time to walk through his reasoning in detail, but I highly recommend this article as an exercise in critical thinking.

After reading the article, I noticed that I felt a bit more lighthearted in my work.

I'm convinced it helped relieve my cognitive dissonance about facilitating technological advances for our society.

You can scan (NEXT FRAG) the red pill below which includes a link to the article, so you'll have it in your phone.

The talk will also be available as a video and a web page if you prefer to just relax and listen.

** Systems of value
- hedonism
- religion
- scientific axiology

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Wozniak's article also serves as a gentle introduction to axiology and value theory.

There are three major systems of value: hedonism, religion and scientific axiology.

Hedonism values pleasure and devalues pain. It's been around since multi-celled organisms developed nervous systems.

Religion uses faith and reason to ascribe value.

And Scientific axiology strives to measure value using only the scientific method. 

All other systems of value can be categorized in or among these three.

Most people apply a conglomeration of these three value systems to evaluate their goals.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
How can I measure the value I place on learning?

Before I reveal my method, I'd like to offer this disclaimer.

This is my first stab at the problem and the method is far from perfect.

There are simpler methods, but they would require more time, time I didn't have in preparing for this talk.

The simplest method I could think of would be to measure how much time in a given month do I dedicate specifically to learning.

Unfortunately, I don't have a month to spare, so please excuse the complexity of my next best solution. Drum roll please...

The method I've chosen aims to quantify the role of learning in my life.

My general strategy is to look back over my life, identify significant memories, and try to assign a quantifiable value to that memory somehow.

How can I break this big problem up in to smaller pieces?

Inspired by Maslow's hierarchical pyramid of needs, and borrowing from the plethora of life-coaching material on then internet, I've divided my life into 10 major categories.

(NEXT FRAG)

These are: Health, Family, Friends, Community, Art, Career / Business, Fun / Hobbies/ Recreation, Philosophical / Spiritual, Personal Finance, Personal Development & Learning.

These categories serve a dual purpose.

First, they serve as a way for me to look back on my life memories and recall stories that relate to a given category, which I will call the home category.

Second, they serve as a way to quantify value, where each category will be worth 100 points.

In fairness, I want to recall the same number of stories from each category.

Each memory has the potential to impact between 1 and 10 life categories.

If a memory affects multiple categories, the home category of that memory will score 100 points for each affected category, and each affected category will score 100 points for being "tagged" by that memory.

For example, if a memory from the learning category about learning to ride my bike affects 3 categories, Fun, Family and Learning, then the home category of of learning will earn 300 points, and the other two categories Fun and Family will earn 100 points each.

In this way, categories earn points for playing a role in my significant life memories. 

The logic behind this strategy is that a memory which stands out in my mind is a valuable memory, otherwise I would have forgotten about it.

The obvious exceptions are painful memories, like when I broke my arm, which will be filtered out, unless they have some obvious life value.

As you can imagine, this process has the potential to bring up deeply personal memories, and lucky for you we don't have time for my entire life story.

Instead I've curated a short list of memories which are relevant to this talk.

I'll use 2 or 3 of the following stories as examples of how I scored memories according to described method.

Where should we start? How about near the beginning?

** Worldview

#+BEGIN_NOTES
My first story stems from the family category

At the age of 3, I lived with my Mother in an apartment on the outskirts of Lincoln, Nebraska.

In the evenings we sat on the balcony and watched the sunset over the golden wheat fields and countryside.

One evening the sun set down right behind an old barn on the horizon.

This was an exciting event for me.

I was convinced that the sun was hiding just behind that barn, just over the hill where it had disappeared. 

I remember, more than anything, just how badly I wanted to touch the sun!

My mother, instead of telling me that that's just not the way the world works, drove me out to that barn the very next day at sunset.

I could see for myself that we were at the barn, and still the sun was setting yet a long ways off.

I learned something that day about how sunsets work, but I learned a far more important lesson about the power of demonstration and involving the pupil smack dab in the middle of a lesson, or a barn in the middle of nowhere in this case. Thanks Mom!

** Imagination

#+BEGIN_NOTES

My next story is about imagination.

At the age 6 my best friend was Steve Peterson.

Steve and I met at the apartments where I lived in Columbia, SC.

He had a single Mom and so did I.

The four of us were practically inseparable, and remain lifelong friends to this day.

His mother Barbara Peterson was a kindergarten teacher. She was very good at her job.

So good in fact, that she found herself being interviewed by Mr. Rogers on PBS. Mr Rogers!

Playing at Steve's house was the best.

Mrs. Peterson was masterful at sparking imagination.

She encouraged us to use our imaginations often.

She sewed super hero and other costumes for us to wear.

The memory that came to mind instantly when I challenged myself to recall a life memory from the friends category is the day Steve and I went into a restaurant to order a hamburger.

Steve and I were 5 and 6 years old, dressed up as college football players, each of us donning a uniform of the big local rivalry here in SC, the Carolina Gamecocks and Clemson Tigers.

What makes the moment so memorable is that just before we got out of the car to go inside the local Wendy's, we turned to Mrs. Peterson and pleaded with her not tell anyone we weren't really college football players.

"Oh no, of course I wouldn't give you away!" she said.

It makes me smile to this day to think that we actually thought we'd be mistaken for college athletes.

Mrs. Peterson taught me more than I could summarize in 10 hours, much less one, but that day I learned how to pretend which it turns out is a great skill to have.

** Childlike Wonder & Awe

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
This next story is great example of inside out vs outside in learning, as it spans both.

When I was around 8 years old I had a subscription to a kid's science magazine.

I remember how amazed I was at learning new facts about the world.

Animals were often my favorite subjects.

Like how a blue whale's arteries are so large in diameter that a small child could swim through them. You know, cool stuff!

I loved getting a new magazine at the beginning of the month, and would devour it within days, completely self-motivated to learn, a classic example of inside-out education.

The other thing I loved to do was share these facts with other people, and watch their faces light up with amazement, shock or awe.

Sometimes though, my timing was terrible.

It was Thanksgiving day at Mrs. Peterson's and the table was set with Turkey and fixings.

Everyone was hungry and we were ready to dig in, but first I needed to share an important fact with everyone!

"Did you guys know that black pepper contains the highest percentage of insect parts, according the FDA?"

I'll never forget the look on my Mom's face.

She had some outside-in educating to do! And she did it.

I'll never forget the joy of reading those magazines.

I treasure the child-like sense of awe & wonder that I learned to cultivate by reading through those pages. And, of course, I always watch my manners at the dinner table! :O

Thanks again, Mom!

** Professor McKee 2

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
In college, I had one professor that came to mind instantly when thinking about the career category.

Professor Jim McKee.

Professor McKee was a consummate professional.

Being in his class felt more like participating in a job interview than it did a classroom.

His sayings still echo in my head:

"If you're not 5 minutes early, you're 5 minutes late!"

"You never get a second chance to make a first impression!"

And the arm length rule:

"If you're within arms length of someone, stick out your hand and introduce yourself."

Professor McKee told a story of his first big job break.

He had an interview in an office building down town.

He applied the arm length rule and introduced himself to the person riding the elevator with him.

Turns out that person was his interviewer for the job, which of course he got.

But the image of professor McKee I'll never get out of my head is the day he taught us how to draw cash flow diagrams in our engineering economics class.

"The day of your investment you draw the arrow down because you have to part with your money so you're feeling low, low, low," he said as he drooped his torso, arms practically mopping the floor.

"The day of your return on investment, you draw the arrow up, up, up!" he shouted as hopped on top his his desk and jumped up and down to the rhythm of his mantra.

Professor McKee taught me just how much difference one teacher can in a person's life. Thanks Professor McKee.

** Career in IT
#+BEGIN_NOTES 

  After college, over 20 years ago, I wanted to pursue a career in IT.

  I decided to try a shortcut to breaking into the industry. I would get /*'certified'*/.

  There was just one problem.

  Despite 18 years of being a student, from pre-school to undergrad engineering degree, I had /*sparse*/ confidence in my own ability to efficiently learn.

  I signed up for a 6 month certification program, but delayed starting by 2 months, in order to study the fundamentals of adult education. 

  My brief studies about learning taught me to focus on demonstrating practical skill. 

  I purchased two computers from a trade show for $400, set them up with multiple boot configurations, and materialized every example in my text books into real world use cases.

  I also got a job at the certification office on the weekends, setting up workstations for the next week's courses, where I logged just over 2400 system installations.

  I was the first student to complete the local training program. I passed my tests with flying colors.

  I executed two successful job interviews in a row, allowing me to choose a place to begin my career.

  These actions were inspired by /investing/ 2 months of my life in learning about adult education.
   
  My shortcut driven efforts paid off in terms of personal finances, but were costly in another way.

  By succeeding at taking a shortcut, by taking the easy way, I reinforced a personal strategy that would cost precious time and money when I started to learn how to program, which I'll talk more about soon.

  The experience of learning about adult education was my first brush with learning about learning itself, but the profundity of it didn't sink in at the   time.

  It would be years later that I would look back and really glean wisdom from the experience.

** Finding Clojure 

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
    My path to finding Clojure has been long and sometimes emotionally painful.

    Instead of structured struggle, much of the path has felt like needless struggle.

    I'd like to help other newcomers find their way before they suffer the bumps and bruises I've experienced. 

    I started programming at age 10.  By age 12, I was more interested in riding my bike than in staying inside the house.

    A few years ago, I started dabbling in programming again, in my spare time.

    I grew an interest in web applications, and had multiple ideas for potential businesses.

    I looked for 'easy' ways to make web apps.

    Even though the lessons I learned 20 years before about adult education were generally helpful, I picked up a way of thinking that needed to be unlearned.

    And given my sometimes stubborn nature, I had to learn the following lesson twice: Stop trying to do it the easy way!

    Twice, I tried to learn an 'easy' web framework, when I should have been focused on the fundamentals of programming.

    By the time I heard Rich Hickey's talk, Simple Made Easy, I was totally receptive to his message.

    In my own words, what I learned from him is that many approaches appear easy at first glance. But most /easy/ systems are actually highly complicated systems masquerading behind a thin veil of superficial usability.

    These systems will consume more time and resources the further a team gets into a greenfield project, before eventually grinding the progress of customization requests to a near halt.

    My main goal is to work with code and technology which facilitates understanding, allowing the team to focus on the domain problem at hand.

    I want to avoid being forced by my technology stack into saying, "No! Sorry, we can't do that, because the system won't allow it!"

    The main reason I've chosen Clojure is that I want to learn to think about the fundamentals of programming in the same way that Rich Hickey does - identities, values, time, these are his fundamental building blocks.

    Masters of a craft, discover, not only its essence, but how to practice it with great efficiency.

    Who are the professionals? What results are they achieving? And how are they achieving those results.

    I will save time, not by finding the easy way, but by mastering the fundamentals that bring very difficult problems within the reach of mortals, like me. Thank you Rich Hickey!

* New goal
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
   I have an ambitious goal. I want to be skilled in all aspects of creating a web app, from the front end to the back, using Clojure technologies, including ClojureScript, Datomic, React Native, Arachne and so on. 

   But first, the fundamentals! Identity, values, time.

   Forests emerge from a single tree, and a tree from a single seed.

   That's the essence of my message today -- planting seeds.

   Someone planted a seed in my mind over a year ago about taking the 4 hour online course, /Learning How to Learn/ by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski.

   After slowly going through the course over many months, branching my studies off of the main curriculum by following the compass of my curiosity, I can say unequivocally taking this course has super-charged my learning!

   To my delight, it's helped me in ways I never expected. Yes, my learning skills are sharper and broader, and growing. 

   But I'm also sleeping better, eating better and enjoying playful breaks from my work to exercise in the back yard.

   Most profoundly, my relationships with family, friends and colleagues are flourishing, thanks to a better understanding of myself and others.

   But there's always room for improvement and as much as things have gotten better, its feels like this journey is just beginning.

   What I'm trying to say is I'm a *big* fan. 

   If I could plant just one seed today, it would be *this* course.

   The crucial benefit I've gained from my Learning How to Learn /studies/, is the confidence that I /will/ continue to improve my learning skills, which will accelerate learning in every other aspect of my life, including learning to program.

   Perhaps you're already confident in your ability to learn, and why shouldn't you be!?!

   After all you've gotten this far along in life, right!?!

   Fortunately, the brain comes pre-built to learn.

   The challenge then is this: can we learn to work with the natural 'grain' of the brain, can we learn even more efficiently? And what would our world look like if we did this en masse? 

   My hope is that you will find at least one thing in this talk that will help you in your own learning journey, whatever your goals may be.

   Toward that end I will touch on many aspects of the subject of learning. Each aspect can serve as a unique personal starting point, or fork in the road, for your own curiosity driven research.

These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.
* Prior Art
** http://lifehacker.com/top-10-ways-to-teach-yourself-to-code-1684250889A
** https://hackpledge.org/

* Old Pitches 
** How can we best support the needs of Clojure learners? Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential? Much progress has already been made, but what more can we do, together, to reach this goal?
** A community-centered brainstorming session facilitated by vulnerably sharing my unconventional ideas about learning to program, and graciously inviting others to share their own. An experiment in group problem solving applied to the problem of learning 'Clojure'.
*** 'Clojure' as used here is a heavily overloaded term, referring the body of knowledge encompassing Clojure(ish) technologies: ClojureScript, Datomic, React, React Native, bash/zshell, deployment technologies such as immutable infrastructure etc. etc. etc.
** I intend to foster an interactive conversation with my audience about how we can create stronger and more creative mentor/apprentice relationships in our growing community. The jumping off point would be my personal learning path of going from Hero to Zero. (Hero to Zero is a greatly overloaded term that is meaningful to me, but likely mysterious to others, so it will be a conversational thread wherein I can relay my personal experience of learning programming and Clojure.)


* Answers aren't everything
Questions are powerful on their own.

I think this one is worth revisiting again and again.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
This question could have been tackled any number of ways. I stumbled upon this one by following my nose and trying not to fall behind on my deadline. 



I would enjoy revisiting the question anew, perhaps from a purely mathematical perspective. The options are endless, but decisions must be made, which by definition means possibilities are temporarily killed off. Decide - /de/ *to cull away* - /cide/ *to kill*.

I hope this talk can reach out and find aspiring learners at the outset of their learning journey. What can we do together to make learning Clojure a fantastic experience for everyone?
